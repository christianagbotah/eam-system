Task: Fix socket.io 404 on port 3004 and Machine Availability page error

Work Log:
- Investigated socket.io 404: notification-service mini-service on port 3004 not running on VPS
- Rewrote useWebSocket hook to perform pre-flight health check against port 3005 /health endpoint before connecting
- Fixed health check URL from `/?XTransformPort=3005/health` to `/health?XTransformPort=3005` (correct Caddy gateway format)
- When service is unavailable, hook retries every 30s instead of spamming 404 polling requests
- Set primary transport to 'websocket' with 'polling' as fallback, disabled upgrade to reduce noise

- Investigated Machine Availability "failed to load machines" error
- Discovered root cause: MachineAvailabilityPage.tsx used bare `fetch()` without Authorization header
- The Next.js middleware (src/proxy.ts) blocks ALL /api/* requests without Bearer token → returns 401
- The frontend received 401 response, saw `success: false`, showed error toast
- Fixed by replacing bare `fetch()` with `api.get()` from the shared API client which auto-injects auth headers
- Also added console.error logging for better debugging on VPS
- Improved error toast to show actual error details

- Also identified 20 other bare fetch() calls across 4 files (HistorianPages, ObservabilityPages, ConnectivityPages, MaintenancePages) that have the same auth issue — not yet fixed

Stage Summary:
- Files changed: src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts, src/components/modules/MachineAvailabilityPage.tsx
- Root causes identified and fixed for both reported issues
- Both files pass ESLint cleanly
